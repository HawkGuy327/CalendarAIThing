# AI-Powered Calendar Project

This project is split into two main phases:

---

## ðŸ“… Phase 1 â€“ Build the Calendar UI

The goal is to create a functional, web-based calendar with features youâ€™d expect in a basic calendar app:
- View by week/day
- Add and view events or tasks
- Edit or delete events
- (Eventually) support recurring events and basic task categorization

This part serves as the foundation for the next phase and also helps me build core web development skills using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## ðŸ¤– Phase 2 â€“ Add AI-Powered Scheduling

The next step is to build an AI system that:
- Accepts tasks/assignments with due dates and estimated completion time
- Automatically schedules them in available calendar slots
- Adjusts plans based on user preferences and habits (e.g., late-night worker, procrastinator)
- Lets users override AI decisions manually
- Eventually syncs with Google Calendar (for shared events or conflicts)

## ðŸŽ¯ My Current Focus

I'm a beginner in:
- Web development
- App building
- AI implementation

So I'm taking a gradual, iterative approach:
1. Finish the calendar UI and core features
2. Explore and experiment with AI-based task placement
3. Tweak, adapt, and improve until it becomes useful for me personally

This is a learning-first project. I may cut features or take a long time â€” but the goal is to make something I actually want to use.

## ðŸš§ Planned Features (Eventually)

- AI scheduling with habit adaptation
- Google Calendar sync
- Manual override of AI-scheduled tasks
- Persistent task storage
- Responsive design for mobile use

## ðŸ“Œ Status

**Currently working on:** Basic calendar layout and event input
