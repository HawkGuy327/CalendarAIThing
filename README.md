# CalendarAIThing
This project, for the most part, is split into two main sections/ideas.

First - Making an actual calendar. Something simple with all of the features you would want in a normal calendar. Events, Tasks, etc.

Second - Making an AI that will, based on given tasks/assigments you give it, give the user certain times in their calendar that they should work on the given thing
