# CalendarAIThing
This project, for the most part, is split into two main sections/ideas.

First - Making an actual calendar. Something simple with all of the features you would want in a normal calendar. Events, Tasks, etc.

Second - Making an AI that will, based on given tasks/assigments you give it, give the user certain times in their calendar that they should work on the given thing based on the amount of time necessary and the due date (given by the user).
Additionally, I would also like to add some extra features like the ability for the AI to adapt to user habits (Procrastinating, working in the morning, working in the night, etc), the ability for events to directly port from Google Calendar for shared calendars, and the ability for the user to change the plans made by the AI if something sudden comes up or the just don't like the schedule.

I, as a very much so beginner at Website Building, App Building, and AI, will likely either cut out some functions or will take an extended time to finish. For now, my goal is to just get my foundations set by actually making the calendar, then messing around and tweaking the AI for extended periods of time until it feels good enough that I start using it in my everyday life.
